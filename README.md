Summary
=======
 *** Update for TB 78 on  addons.thunderbird.net  (Nostalgy++) ***
 (https://addons.thunderbird.net/de/thunderbird/addon/nostalgy_ng/?src=ss)
 
 For the xpi for 68, please look here: v1.0.16a: https://github.com/opto/nostalgy-xpi/releases


Nostalgy is an extension for Mozilla Thunderbird whose purpose is to
save time by doing more operations with the keyboard. If you want to
use Thunderbird without sacrificing the productivity you had with good
old mutt/pine, this extension is for you!

Original code by Alain Frisch. Modified by opto (Klaus Buecher) for TB 68
and now TB 78.

Nostalgy adds keyboard shortcuts to change folder, move/copy messages,
with folder name auto-completion (using only the keyboard).  Also
includes a system of rules to suggest a target folder for saving
messages; re-creates Eudora's Alt-Click; facilitates navigation in the
3-pane window; makes it easy to change between To/Bcc/Cc fields in the
composer. All that with the keyboard only!

Other keyboard actions include: changing focus between panes, scroll
the message while keeping the focus on the thread pane, changing
header in the composer (To/Cc/Bcc), adding an attachment, hide the
folder view.
