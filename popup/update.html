   <p>By keyboard, esc followed by c, the cc line is shown and focused. Similiarly, esc - b opens the bcc , esc-t the to line. 
    Just as in earlier versions, cc (+space), bcc (+space), to (+space) can be used as well (<b>disabled in 2.2.1</b>).</p>
<p></p>    
   <p></p>    
   <li><b>Composer:  Always show cc or bcc line</b></li>

      In TB 78, Thunderbird internals changed widely. Klaus Buecher/opto has been working to make {addon} fully 
      functional again for Thunderbird 78. At lot of personal time has been put into this. I appreciate if you can support
    this work by a donation. </p>
