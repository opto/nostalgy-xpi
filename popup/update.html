    <li><b>Attachments and image thumbnails:</b></li>
    <p>Esc-r opens the attachment list. Esc-1, esc-2 etc. display attached images 1, 2, ... inside TB (no external app needed).
      </p>
 
      <li><b>Width of folderbox:</b></li>
      <p>The width of the folderbox can be adjusted in about:preferences (Number of characters if foldernames are long).</p>
      <p></p>
 
      <li><b>Bug fixes: </b></li>
       
      <p>Select final folder by enter - Fix autocomplete in rules window - Put instructions into tooltip to gain space.</p>

    <p>A new rule can now be created from the main window. The folderset used for the last email move can be inserted into a new rule. 
      In the rule list, the rules can be directly applied without opening the folders in Thunderbird's main view.

   <p>By keyboard, esc followed by c, the cc line is shown and focused. Similiarly, esc - b opens the bcc , esc-t the to line. 
    Just as in earlier versions, cc (+space), bcc (+space), to (+space) can be used as well (<b>disabled in 2.2.3</b>).</p>

   <li><b>Composer:  Always show cc or bcc line</b></li>
